  Some information on the password protection of notes:
  <ul>
    <li>DO NOT USE a password you have used elsewhere, there is NO guarantee that the password cannot be discovered</li>
    <li>Notes <u>are not</u> encrypted, just password protected to stop casual user access</li>
    <li>You can not password protect a blank note and deleting all text from a note will also remove the password</li>
    <li>Anyone who has access to the files on the server would be able to read the note if they wanted to</li>
    <li>The password protection is only intended to give a very simple level of security</li>
    <li>Want to store a secure note? Keep it somewhere else</li>
    <li>NEVER store anything confidential</u> in any note</li>
  </ul>
